# Test-Driven Development: Money Example

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Jest / testing (in `/__tests__` folder)

## Exploration of TTD

In summary, the methodology known as `Test-Driven Development` results in cleaner code that works. The main benefit that I see is the sheer focus that gets directed to writing tests in the first place. Without this, I believe I wouldn't have bothered to write tests at all because my experience in a fast-paced work environment did not leave much time for such luxuries.

While there is an upfront cost to working with TTD, the inversion of the work order -- placing testing at the forefront, not as an optional afterthought -- leads to some interesting effects:

- Clearer elucidation of requirements and expected behaviors, leading to better design
- Better design leads to better maintainability and extendability
- More confidence in final result due to constant refactoring throughout entire process (and making use of tests in the first place)

## Exploration of OOP

Object-oriented programming was also an enlightening piece of this exercise. I was able to notice the relationships between the different classes in a hierachical manner. While OOP in JavaScript is somewhat limited, I was able to recreate the classes of the problem at hand with great success.
